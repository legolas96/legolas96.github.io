Welcome to my website !!!

I am a final year dual degree student at [IIT Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in/) pursuing a major in Metallurgical and Materials Engieering and a minor in Physics. I hail from the [*"City of Destiny"*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visakhapatnam).

## Research Interests

* Energy and battery materials.
* Prediction of 0 K energetics using various *ab inito* techniques.
* Estimation of finite temperature thermodynamic properties using ab initio phonon calculations.
* Calculation of phase diagrams using CALPHAD method.
* Computational Materials Science

## Workshops
Attended JAIST-India workshop on Computational Material Science conducted at IIT Madras, Dec 2016

## Conference Presentations
